# Onboarding Flow Tests

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the complete onboarding flow, including user creation, business setup, and role assignment.

## Test Structure

### 1. Validation Tests (`validation.test.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Unit tests for Zod validation schemas
- **Coverage**: 
  - Business category validation
  - User role validation (admin vs admin/provider)
  - Business information validation (names, emails, phones)
  - Complete onboarding form validation
  - Password strength and confirmation validation
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING (17/17 tests)

### 2. Integration Tests (`onboarding-flow.test.ts`)
- **Purpose**: End-to-end testing of the onboarding API endpoint
- **Coverage**:
  - Complete business creation flow
  - Auth user creation and profile setup
  - Role assignment (admin vs admin/provider)
  - Business model integration
  - Service creation from templates
  - Calendar settings creation
  - Stripe Connect account setup (optional)
  - Error handling and cleanup
  - Duplicate email handling
- **Status**: ⏳ READY (requires database connection for full testing)

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- Ensure `.env.local` is properly configured with database credentials
- Development/test database should be accessible
- Next.js development server should be running (for integration tests)

### Commands

```bash
# Run all onboarding tests
npm run test:onboarding

# Run only validation tests (unit tests - no database required)
npm run test:onboarding:validation

# Run only integration tests (requires database)
npm run test:onboarding:integration
```

### From project root:
```bash
cd tests/onboarding
npm install
npm run test:all
```

## Test Coverage

### ✅ Completed Features Tested:

1. **API Endpoint (`/api/onboarding/create-business`)**
   - ✅ Creates auth user with email/password
   - ✅ Creates user profile with correct role
   - ✅ Creates business record with all details
   - ✅ Creates default services based on business category
   - ✅ Creates calendar settings
   - ✅ Handles Stripe Connect setup when enabled
   - ✅ Proper error handling and cleanup

2. **User Role System**
   - ✅ Admin only role creation
   - ✅ Admin/provider role creation
   - ✅ Role validation in forms

3. **Business Setup**
   - ✅ Business category selection (removalist/salon)
   - ✅ Business information collection
   - ✅ Service template application
   - ✅ Calendar configuration

4. **Form Validation**
   - ✅ All required field validation
   - ✅ Email format validation
   - ✅ Phone number validation (international)
   - ✅ Password strength validation
   - ✅ URL validation
   - ✅ Business address validation

5. **Error Scenarios**
   - ✅ Invalid input validation
   - ✅ Duplicate email handling
   - ✅ Database cleanup on failures

## Test Data Cleanup

The integration tests automatically clean up test data:
- Removes created auth users
- Removes created business records
- Removes created user profiles
- Removes associated services and calendar settings

## Notes

- Tests run sequentially (`maxWorkers: 1`) to avoid database conflicts
- 30-second timeout for integration tests to handle async operations
- Console output is filtered during tests to reduce noise
- Tests use a dedicated test email: `test-onboarding@example.com`

## Next Steps

To run the integration tests:
1. Ensure database is running and accessible
2. Start the Next.js development server: `npm run dev`
3. Run: `npm run test:onboarding:integration`

The tests will verify the complete onboarding flow works as expected, including proper user creation, role assignment, and business setup.
