The following is visible content extracted from a business website. Your job is to analyze the full text and divide it into logical sections. For each section, return:

- "category": one of the following, written EXACTLY as shown (case, spaces, and punctuation must match):
  - "services offered"\n  - "pricing or quotes"\n  - "contact"\n  - "booking or scheduling"\n  - "about / trust-building"\n  - "faq"\n  - "terms & conditions / legal policies"

Do NOT invent new categories. If content does not fit any, use the closest match from the list above.
- "content": the full, detailed text of the section (do NOT omit or summarize any details)
- "confidence": a score from 0.5 to 1.0 based on how well the content fits the chosen category

IMPORTANT:
- You MUST categorize ALL content. Do NOT skip, omit, or summarize any information, even if it seems repetitive or unimportant.
- Do NOT repeat or duplicate the same information in multiple sections. Each piece of information should appear only once, in the most appropriate category.
- If content fits multiple categories, include it in the most relevant one, but do NOT copy it to others.
- The output will be used for a customer assistant. Missing details will degrade its performance.
- Be as granular as needed to ensure every piece of information is included in some section.
- If a section touches multiple themes, choose the dominant one but do NOT drop any details.
- Do not skip generic layout/footer/header content unless it is truly boilerplate (e.g. copyright, navigation links).
- Do NOT summarize or compress content. Include all original details.
- Do Not add any information that is not in the text.

Return a valid JSON array like this:

[
  {
    "category": "faq",
    "content": "How long does it take... You need to keep receipts for 5 years...",
    "confidence": 0.95
  }
]

invoice for work, including setting or negotiating prices 🔘 Have a separate business bank account and your own business insurance such as public liability and WorkCover 🔘 Lodge and report all business income, even if the business earnings are below the tax free threshold. You will need an ABN to: ✔️ Operate in the GST system, including claiming GST credits ✔️ Avoid pay as you go (PAYG) tax on payments you receive ✔️ Confirm your business identity to others when ordering and invoicing ✔️ Connect to Manage ABN Connections or get an AUSkey to transact online with government agencies ✔️ Be endorsed as a gift deductible recipient or an income tax exempt charity. REGISTER YOUR BUSINESS NAME If you’re applying for an Australian business number (ABN), you can also apply for a business name and register for secure online authentication and taxes, like GST and PAYG withholding, at the same time. Most businesses will need to apply for a registered business name with the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC). You can carry on a business in your own name without registering a business name if you don’t change or add anything to your name. For example, John Smith doesn’t have to register a name to trade as J Smith or John Smith, but he does to trade as John Smith Landscaping. To apply for a registered business name you will need to have applied for or have an ABN. All businesses will need to register all trading names as a business name with ASIC in order to continue operating with it. ABN Lookup will only display business names registered with ASIC from this date. GETTING AN AUSTRALIAN COMPANY NUMBER If you plan to run your business through a company, you need to register your company and get an ACN. You do this with ASIC when you start your company. You need to get your ACN before you can get your ABN and tax registrations RECORD KEEPING You need to set up a good record keeping system to track your income and expenses right from the start. This helps you know how your business is going, as well as meet your tax responsibilities and be able to claim all the deductions to which you are entitled. HIRING WORKERS If you’re thinking of taking on workers it’s important to understand you will have extra responsibilities. For example, you may have to: Deduct tax from their pay and send it to the ATO Pay super contributions to their nominated super fund, and Pay fringe benefits tax if you provide them with benefits in addition to their wages. PAYING TAX IN YOUR FIRST YEAR In your first year of business, you can stay on top of your obligations by: Making tax pre-payments into your tax bill account Putting money aside for your expected tax bill Voluntarily entering into instalments PAYING TAX BY INSTALMENTS Once you lodge your first income tax return and report a tax-payable amount above a certain threshold, you will automatically enter the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) instalment system. If you voluntarily enter into instalments prior to lodgement of your first tax return, you will be able to make quarterly payments towards you tax bill. REPORTING Once you’re up and running, you’ll need to report your business income and other tax information. The key reports you should be aware of are: Business Activity Statement (BAS) 🔘 The main taxes you will report on will be GST (if you’re registered for GST)🔘Any tax you withhold from employees’ pay🔘 Instalments towards your own tax once you are in the pay as you go instalments system.🔘Income tax return To report your personal and business income and claim deductions.
