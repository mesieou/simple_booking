A: Our pricing is based on time and materials with a minimum charge of 1.5 hours. We charge per minute from when we arrive at your pickup location until we finish at your drop-off location. This includes loading, travel time, and unloading. Same rates apply for weekdays, weekends, and public holidays. Q: What's included in the base charge? A: The base charge covers the minimum 1.5 hours of service, truck rental, fuel for local moves, and all our professional moving equipment (dollies, hydraulic lift, straps, blankets, bubble wrap, plastic wrapper, and assembly tools). Q: Do you charge for travel time between locations? A: Yes, travel time between your pickup and drop-off locations is included in the total time charged. We use the most efficient route to minimize this cost. Q: Can I get a quote over the phone? A: We can provide an estimated quote based on your description, but the most accurate pricing comes from our on-site assessment. Our per-minute rate with 1.5-hour minimum means you get transparent, fair pricing.\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"confidenceReason\": \"The content is explicitly about pricing and quotes, detailing how costs are calculated and what is included.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"category\": 0,\n    \"content\": \"=== SERVICES === Q: What's the difference between one-person and two-person service?

Two-person service is faster and safer for larger items. Q: What size truck do you use? A: We use medium-sized trucks with the following dimensions: - Length: 4.2 meters - Width: 2.1 meters - Height: 2.0 meters Our trucks are equipped with loading ramps, tie-downs, and protective materials.
